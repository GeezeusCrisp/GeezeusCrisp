- @GeezeusCrisp  Hello world, I'm Giles! (pronounced Guy-Yells, but I don't really care) Gil for short. I'm an editor, videographer and half-finished not-close-enough-to-being-published writer. I'll write about anything, really, but my favorite projects are high fantasy or slice of life. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Writing stories, creating art, metal music, goth clubs, gaming, environmentalism
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I love to learn about the local nonprofit community development/engagement activities. It warms my jaded heart. I'm trying to leatn website development, but not doing a very good job. Created this account so I could make a website for the documentary I'm co-producing atm
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything with passion in it. I would LOVE to make a game with a story so rich it rivals the classics someday, but don't we all? So many ideas fallen to the wayside over such a silly little thing as inexperience. 
- 📫 How to reach me: My throwaway email is iigillybeanii@gmail.com (feel free to sign me up for random bird fact newsletters)
